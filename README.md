# Translation Diff âœ¨ðŸ“œ

A tiny React + Vite web app that helps translators **compare and refine machine generated translations**.
It shows a _track-changes style_ diff between the original automated translation (e.g. from GPT) and your manual edits, with full support for **bidirectional Hebrew â†” English text**.

## Features

â€¢ Word-level diff highlighting (insertions = green, deletions = red, equal = normal) using a Longest Common Subsequence algorithm.

â€¢ Bi-directional (LTR & RTL) UI â€” Hebrew words render correctly inside English sentences and vice-versa.

â€¢ In-place WYSIWYG editor that keeps IME composition, undo / redo and copy-paste working.

â€¢ One-click translation through the **OpenAI Chat Completions API** (GPT-4o-mini by default) with configurable system prompt, target language, temperature and max tokens.

â€¢ Local Storage persistence for API key, preferences and a timestamped translation history.

â€¢ Self-tests covering tokenisation & diff edge-cases (`npm run selftest`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev
```

> ðŸ’¡ The first time you load the page you will be prompted for an **OpenAI API key**
> (stored only in `localStorage.tds_api_key`). You can generate one at <https://platform.openai.com/>.

### Scripts

| Script            | Description                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | Vite dev server with HMR            |
| `npm run build`   | Production build to `dist/`         |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build        |
| `npm run lint`    | ESLint (config in `eslint.config.js`)|

## Project Structure

```
src/
  App.jsx          # main component with diff & editor logic
  assets/          # static assets (SVG logos â€¦)
  index.css        # Tailwind CSS directives
  main.jsx         # React DOM entry-point
public/
  ...              # static files copied verbatim
```

The diff logic lives in `src/App.jsx` and is completely framework-agnostic â€” you can copy-paste the helper functions into any project.

## Releasing

This repository follows **semantic versioning**. A release is created via the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Commit any pending changes
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: amazing new thing"

# Tag & create release notes (replace x.y.z)
GH_VERSION="v$(npm version --json | jq -r '.version')"   # or set manually

gh release create "$GH_VERSION" \
  --generate-notes \
  --title "$GH_VERSION" \
  --verify-tag
```

The built static site can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.
